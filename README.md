Azure Notification Hubs

Its is a Demo project created using Xamarin platform to send and receive push notifications on android phone, IOS and desktop windows 

This feature is being used in my Final year project SAINT (Smart Classroom using Ambient Intelligence). A professor during a lecture can create
